# Sample Portfolio page using Bootstrap 4

## Description 

Being confident in writing your skelton in HTML is important. If you want that skeleton to look good, you need to wrap it in beautiful skin using CSS. Styling in front end web development involves and intese amount of trial, error, and experience to get layouts right. Putting together a thematic cohesive page is a beast all on it's own. [Bootstrap](https://bootstrap.com/) is a handy toolkit that allows rapid development of mobile friendly websites with minimal CSS styling

Using the base 12 grid system, [Bootstrap](https://bootstrap.com/) allows us to set individual breakpoints using screen sizes (sm, md, lg, xl) to get the html elements displayed exactly how we want to. For this sample portfolio, I designed a three page responsive layout using Bootstrap. My personal goal was to use as little custom css as possible to get the page looking as close to the mock up guide we were provided.
